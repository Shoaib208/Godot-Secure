## Features

- **Strong Encryption**: Utilizes Camellia-256, a robust encryption algorithm, to protect your assets.
- **Unique Security Tokens**: Generates unique tokens for each build, enhancing security.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed for seamless integration with the Godot engine.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on multiple platforms, ensuring your game assets are secure everywhere.
- **Open Source**: Freely available for modification and enhancement.

## Installation

To get started, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Shoaib208/Godot-Secure/releases) section. Download the latest version of Godot Secure. After downloading, follow these steps:

1. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file.
2. **Add to Godot**: Place the extracted folder into your Godot project's `addons` directory.
3. **Enable the Addon**: Open your Godot project, go to `Project Settings`, then `Plugins`. Enable Godot Secure.

### System Requirements

- Godot Engine 4.x or later
- Compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Usage

After installation, you can start using Godot Secure to protect your game assets. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1. **Open Your Project**: Launch Godot and open your project.
2. **Access Godot Secure**: Navigate to the `Addons` menu and select Godot Secure.
3. **Configure Settings**: Adjust the settings to your preference, including encryption options and security tokens.
4. **Encrypt Assets**: Select the assets you want to encrypt and initiate the encryption process.

### Encrypting Your Assets

To encrypt your assets:

- Choose the assets from your project folder.
- Click on the "Encrypt" button in the Godot Secure interface.
- Wait for the process to complete. The encrypted assets will replace the original files.

## Encryption Process

Godot Secure uses the Camellia-256 algorithm to encrypt your assets. This process involves:

1. **Key Generation**: A secure key is generated for the encryption.
2. **Data Encryption**: The assets are encrypted using the generated key.
3. **Storage**: Encrypted assets are stored in a secure format within your project.

### Why Camellia-256?

Camellia-256 is a strong encryption algorithm recognized for its efficiency and security. It is suitable for various applications, including protecting sensitive data in games. Its features include:

- **High Security**: Provides robust protection against unauthorized access.
- **Performance**: Efficiently encrypts and decrypts data without significant performance loss.

## Security Token System

The unique security token system is a core feature of Godot Secure. Each build generates a distinct security token, which is required for asset decryption. This system ensures that even if an encrypted asset is exposed, it cannot be accessed without the corresponding token.

### How It Works

1. **Token Generation**: A new token is created for each build.
2. **Token Storage**: The token is stored securely within the engine.
3. **Token Validation**: During asset decryption, the system checks the token for validity.

This mechanism significantly enhances the security of your game assets.

## Supported Platforms

Godot Secure supports various platforms, making it versatile for game development:

- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **Linux**
- **Android**
- **iOS**

This broad compatibility ensures that your assets remain secure, regardless of where your game runs.
